Initial website structure was shown on the board and sent to you through e-mail.
}

@HW2{
I decided to use Bootstrap open-source framework (https://getbootstrap.com/) for this website.
- The navigation bar was created with 5 tabs in it: About, Plans, Invest, Team, Contact;
- Background image was added with a text on it;
}

@HW3{
The whole website is functional, all links work. It now contains 5 pages with detailed information about our start-up. Again, the Bootstrap framework was used here, as well as everywhere else on this website.
- Website is fully responsive (was checked using Chrome DevTools)
- Finished App UI graphics in 'About' tab;
- Team description added;
- Contact form was added;
- Chronological timeline was added;
- Wide use of lists and tables can be seen in the code;
}

@HW4{
- Photo slider was added to Team section (team.html)
- Footer was updated
- Contact section is now enabled with Google Forms
- Icon is now a link for Main Page
