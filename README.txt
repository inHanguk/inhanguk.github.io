At the beginning, this website was inteneded to be a travel website, but things changed a lot, but nevertheless, the website structure is still the same. The only thing that changed is the topic, now it is a real start-up description website that our team will use for further business idea pitches. I am responsible for design and website part of the start-up. A lot of graphical work was done in this website, such as app UI mock-ups, feed mock up etc. We are planning to make a platform for foreigners in Korea, and actually won the grand prize at Business Idea Camp.
